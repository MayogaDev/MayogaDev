- ðŸŒ± I'm currently studying Computer Science at National University of Saint Augustine.
- ðŸ’¡ I have intermediate knowledge in C++, C#, and Java.
- ðŸš€ My main focus is on web development, especially technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as React, Vue.js, and ASP.NET Core. I am particularly passionate about deep learning and enjoy developing programs that leverage neural networks and machine learning algorithms.

## Projects
Here are some projects I've worked on:

1. **Recommendation System for Tourist Routes in Arequipa**
   - As part of my academic work, I developed a recommendation system for optimizing tourist routes in the city of Arequipa.
   - Leveraging fuzzy logic, the system suggests optimal routes by considering various tourist attractions.
   - This project allowed me to explore both AI techniques and the beauty of Arequipa's cultural heritage.
